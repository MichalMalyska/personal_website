  <h1>Hi, I'm Michal!</h1>
  I build Machine Learning products. For the last 3 years I was at
  <a href="https://betakit.com/semantic-health-comes-out-of-stealth-to-help-hospitals-use-coded-data/" > Semantic Health </a>
  which I joined as the first employee and led the Machine Learning arm of the company. Before that I worked at Deloitte and Intact Financial in insurance analytics. If you would like a look at a more comprehensive version of my achievements (beyond the resume) you can take a look at my <a href="https://michalmalyska.com/bragsheet" > bragsheet </a>

  <h2>Core Interests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> <b> Education </b> - Through the incredibly hard work of my parents I was awarded the best possible education. I want everyone else to have the same opportunities I did. Whenever I have the bandwidth I share my knowledge by teaching Machine Learning / Statistics at my alma matter - University of Toronto. Other (more public) efforts are a WIP.</li>
    <li> <b> Healthcare </b> - My interest in applying Machine Learning to healthcare was sparked early on in university days, but it really grew thanks to <a href="https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/"> Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi</a> , who taught the ML4Health course at UofT and who made it possible for us to collaborate with the team at St.Michaels hospital in Toronto <a href=""></a>working on documents related to Multiple Sclerosis</li>
    <li> <b> Food </b> - I love to cook, photograph, share, and review food across various cuisines and explore restaurants wherever I go. I especially enjoy showing people the cuisine of my home country - Poland.  </li>
    <li> <b> Agriculture </b> - Everyone who has worked with me / is friends with me has seen my obsession with agriculture (permaculture, AI in AG, regenerative farming) grow over the past couple of years. It's just another natural extension of my passion for food. 
    <li> <b> Photography </b>  - The most recent one of my hobbies, just getting started but this has been a natural progression from taking food photos </li>
  </ul>
