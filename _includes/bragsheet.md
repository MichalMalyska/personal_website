# Semantic Health - ML Lead (2021-2022)

* Hired and lead a team of 7 ML Scientist / Engineers: Managed their professional growth, setting objectives, conducting standups, and nurturing their leadership capabilities.
* Defined Hiring Policies and Interview Processes: Established effective hiring policies, interview questions, scoring systems, and take-home assignments to identify top talent for ML, Data Engineering, and Backend roles.
* ML Product Leadership: Spearheaded ML product roadmapping and delivery, expanding the product into a new market (US).
* Created the long term ML product vision of the company
* Code quality and deployments -> Re wrote the initial product stack reducing technical debt and allowing for new hire onboarding without big issues. Introduced unified code and data standards and processes across the company
* Created multiple new product lines based on customer calls and product insights from internal QA efforts leading to increases of 100k ARR per contract
* Introduced novel non-intrusive data labelling and feedback products allowing to gather more granular labels without impacting the end user's workflow
* Created a custom multi-armed bandit model deployment scheme eliminating guesswork and quadrupling ML deployment velocity to production (monthly to weekly model release cadence)
* Created weekly progress reports and presented at all-hands and led customer calls
* Created extensive model and prediction fallbacks allowing us to eliminate the need for on-call support on the ML side
* Contributed to Open source libraries supporting US Military veteran care efforts. Named the first outside collaborator to the library.
* Contributed optimizations to multiple NLP libraries allowing for parallelization of computation (Spacy extensions + Srsly)
* Supervised research projects leading to multiple scientific publications and product improvements
* Created an active learning approach allowing to improve data labelling efforts reducing costs by >75% 
* Led the MLOps + DevOps efforts to create ML dev and staging cloud environments allowing for end-to-end model testing for PRs which allowed the team to move away from on-prem dev environment testing. 
* Led code review and tech debt improvement sprints across the entire python stack
* Designed and implemented APIs for vending model predictions
* Roadmapped a new MLOps initiative to allow for better data and model monitoring (Feast + MLFlow + Seldon)
* Led internal R&D efforts on new modelling schemes to improve the existing products

# UofT - Teaching (2020-2023)

* Created teaching materials and led the lectures with 0 support at the very start of the pandemic
* Taught a non-technical (med students) audience statistics
* Invited to co-teach advanced ML courses alongside David Duvenaud, Murat Erdogdu, Chris Maddison
* Offered to return to teach the Jimmy Ba Deep Learning course
* Modernized the course curriculum adding Attention, Transformers, and diffusion models to the class

# Semantic Health - Machine Learning Scientist (2019-2020)

* Joined as first (and only technical) employee - architected and built the entire ML stack setting the foundation for the company's AI capabilities
* Developed Transformer-based models consistently surpassing the State-of-the-Art performance on a complex, massively multi-label dataset with significant labeling noise.
* Successfully deployed models to production, initially through Python scripts and database uploads, later optimizing the process by transitioning to Airflow, leading to first long term customer contracts
* Designed and implemented a diverse stack of models, spanning from basic keyword matching to advanced Deep Learning techniques.
* Localizer + Evidence modelling -> built a completely novel model architecture generating supporting evidence for ML predictions 
* Pioneered a novel architecture for generating supporting evidence for ML model predictions, implemented and deployed it leading to a 300% increase in business KPIs for the product
* Engaged with customers and gathered feedback to iterate on model improvements, ensuring alignment with customer needs and expectations.
* Conducted ML feature discovery calls with end users, resulting in the development of simple ML models that significantly enhanced product performance
* Established a custom quality assurance process for on-premises model deployments in a secure environment, guaranteeing model reliability and performance.
* Authored a series of Architecture Decision Records that still serve as the model for decision documents for the company
* Actively contributed to the company's culture by hosting weekly game sessions and fostering a positive and engaging atmosphere in meetings.
* Implemented a comprehensive testing suite for the ML stack, including model minification allowing for pre-commit end-to-end ML testing
* Planned and conducted data and label quality experiments identifying problems, addressed those by creating a novel, ontology-graph based label smoothing algorithm increasing downstream model performance by 35%
* Found and solved a bug in a huge open-source framework (AllenNLP)

# UofT - Masters (2019-2022)

* Part time masters while working a full time (early stage startup) job
* A average (only one course not A+) in challenging courses
* Actively engaged in reasearch leading to Publications and a Research Visitor position at St Michaels hospital in Toronto
* Recognized for expertise, was offered to teach my own cohort as a sessional lecturer in Machine Learning

# UofT - Bachelors (2015-2019)

* President Stats Union - brought it from a dead union (won with 14 total votes for a president of a union with ~6000 members) to multiple yearly events with attendance in the hundreds
* Took on teaching assistant (TA) responsibilities for upper-level courses while still an undergraduate, including instructing students in my own year.
* 4.0 GPA in stats courses
* Allowed to take One-on-One reading courses under famous professors (Dan Simpson, David Duvenaud)
* Actuarial Students National Association (ASNA) leadership from second year - held Director positions for Operations, Events, and Case competition
* Conducted ML research at RiskLab

# Deloitte (2018)
