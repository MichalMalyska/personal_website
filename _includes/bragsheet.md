# UofT - Masters (2019-2022)

* Part time masters while working a full time job
* A average (only one non A+ course) in challenging courses
* Publications + Research Visitor at St Mikes
* Got offered to teach courses - moved to teaching my own cohort as a prof

# Intact (2017)

* Worked on the data side from the start
* First year intern building a relatively large data project on my own (EoE)
* Built GLM pricing models for regulators

# Deloitte (2018)

* Authored a report on the state of AI in insurance
* Reserving audits for a number of customers
* Deployed client-site for almost 8 months - client facing role
* Basically data engineering for a large insurance company to reconcile their book of business (they didnt have it internally)
* Part of the team creating a report for the Ministry of Finance on the state of Auto Insurance in Canada

# Semantic - IC (2019-2020)

* Joined as first (and only technical) employee - built the entire ML stack
* First models - BERT based + benchmarks 
* Built models exceeding SOTA on a very complex (massively multi-label - 300k classes) dataset with large amount of labelling noise
* Deployed those models to production - first just python script + DB upload, moved to Airflow
* Built a stack of models ranging from simple keyword matching to Deep Learning
* Localizer + Evidence modelling -> built a completely novel model architecture generating supporting evidence for ML predictions 
* Gathered customer feedback and iterated on models
* ML feature discovery calls with customers (end users) leading to simple ML models that increased product performance
* Custom QA process for models deployed on-prem in a secure setting
* Created a number of ADRs still used as the model decision documents by the company
* Found and solved a bug in a huge open-source framework (AllenNLP)
* Drove the company culture through hosting weekly games sessions, playing the clown in meetings.
* Created a comprehensive testing suite for the ML stack -> minified models
* Planned and conducted data and label quality experiments identifying problems, addressed those by creating a novel, ontology-graph based label smoothing algorithm increasing downstream model performance by 35%

# Semantic - Lead (2021-2022)

* Hired a team of 7 ML Scientist / Engineers
* Managed a team of 7 ML Scientists / Engineers, doing OKRs, Standups, 1-1s, Career development, pushing them to be leaders and growing
* Created hiring policies, interview questions, scoring systems, take-home assignments
* Led ML product roadmapping and delivery
* Led ML product vision of the company
* Led the product expansion into a new market (US)
* Code quality and deployments -> Re wrote the initial product stack reducing technical debt and allowing for new hire onboarding without big issues. Introduced unified code and data standards and processes across the company
* Created multiple new product lines based on customer calls and product insights from internal QA efforts. Demoed to customers leading to upselling in 100k ARR per contract
* Introduced novel non-intrusive data labelling and feedback products allowing to gather more granular labels without impacting the end user's workflow
* Created a custom multi-armed bandit model deployment scheme eliminating guesswork and quadrupling ML deployment velocity to production (monthly to weekly cadence)
* Created weekly progress reports and presented at all-hands and led customer calls
* Created extensive model and prediction fallbacks allowing us to eliminate the need for on-call support on the ML side
* Contributed to Open source libraries supporting US Military veteran care efforts (medspacy). Named the first outside collaborator to the library
* Contributed optimizations to multiple NLP libraries allowing for parallelization of computation (Spacy extensions + Srsly)
* Supervised research projects leading to multiple scientific publications and product improvements
* Created an active learning approach allowing to improve data labelling efforts reducing costs by >75% 
* Led the MLOps + DevOps efforts to create ML dev and staging cloud environments allowing for end-to-end model testing for PRs which allowed the team to move away from on-prem dev environment testing. 
* Led code review and tech debt improvement sprints across the entire python stack of the company
* Designed and implemented APIs for vending model predictions
* Roadmapped a new MLOps initiative to allow for better data and model monitoring (Feast + MLFlow + Seldon)
* Led internal R&D efforts on new modelling schemes to improve the existing products

# UofT - Teaching (2020-2023)

* Created teaching materials and led the lectures with 0 support at the very start of the pandemic
* Taught a non-technical (med students) audience statistics
* Invited to co-teach advanced ML courses alongside David Duvenaud, Murat Erdogdu, Chris Maddison
* Offered to return to teach the Jimmy Ba Deep Learning course
* Modernized the course curriculum adding Attention, Transformers, and diffusion models to the class

# Family business (2023)

* Built an english version of the site (WP)
* Done Business dev efforts to expand the company to North America

# Misc
* Podcast guest
